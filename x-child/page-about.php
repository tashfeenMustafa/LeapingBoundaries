                    <p>Leaping Boundaries works with a vision to break social barriers where every child is treated 

equally. The project is a girl focused project aimed at increasing visibility of madrasah students 

on platforms such as national debate competitions, the Spelling Bee, leadership platforms such 

as the Bangladesh Youth Leadership Centre's training programmes, art competitions, 

hackathons etc. where they are underrepresented.</p>

The project builds capacity of it's students under three components i.e. Language Development, 

Soft Skills Development, Collaborative Tech Reasoning. The fourth component Psychosocial 

Support ensures that they develop a strong coping mechanism to transition into adulthood. After 

having developed sufficient skills and the necessary coping mechanism the children studying in 

the madrasah education system represent themselves on these platforms.</p>

adolescents will gain greater confidence, a reaffirmed sense of identity and thus better able to 

mitigate their identity crises.  Leaping Boundaries is a project that aims to integrate madrasah 

students into the mainstream by increasing their visibility on mainstream platforms where they 

are traditionally underrepresented. The project works with around around 120 girls and 80 boys 

studying in two alia madrasahs (Madinatul Ulum Women's Kamil Madrasah which is under 

government MPO and Nibras International Madrasah which is sanctioned by the BMEB but 

registered as a society) in Dhaka city to build their capacity in English Language, Soft Skills and 

Information Communication Technology and provides them with psychosocial support to help 

them develop a coping mechanism.</p>

                    <p>It was first initiated in 2012 after reading an article on the Star Campus that highlighted 

the challenges faced by Alia madrasah students. Initially it was a language and 

leadership development programme that focused on building English Language skills. 

The project came to an abrupt halt in 2013 because of political crisis. It was then that it 

was identified that the challenge faced by the sector was not a lack of English language 

skills but a lack of platforms where they were not able to represent themselves. Hence it 

was redesigned and relaunched in February 2014 with a new goal, a new set of 

volunteers and two new madrasahs.Â The project has successfully represented students 

on three platforms since then and is still ongoing.</p>
